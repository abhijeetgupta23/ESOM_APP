# ESOM_APP
Version 1.0 w/o Navigation Drawer

This is the official App for The Economics and Finance Society of Manipal (ESOM) .

The Economics and Finance Society of Manipal, has been founded with the vision of generating a financial and economical understanding among the students across the campus. 
We aim to achieve this by helping students to gain an insight into the intricacies of financial and economic development. 
This will create awareness about financial issues that affect students. 
We aim to induce a general understanding of the economics of a business amongst our members, to help them with their future endeavours.

This App is, generally speaking, a platform reading through all the ESOM blogs uploaded on the official website: http://esom.club/
